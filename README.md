<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->
I'm a French postdoc in Bielefeld, Germany.

I mainly worked on
- [findere](https://github.com/lrobidou/findere), a method for correcting false positives returned by AMQ data structures (e.g. Bloom filters)
- [fimpera](https://github.com/lrobidou/fimpera), a method for correcting abundance queries on counting AMQ data structures (e.g. counting Bloom filters)
- [kfc](https://github.com/lrobidou/kfc), a k-mer counter for large k values (e.g. k >= 200)
